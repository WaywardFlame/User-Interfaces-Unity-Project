This is the project that myself and the others above worked on as part of our User Interfaces class at UTSA during the Spring of 2025. Given that it was a user intefaces class, we focused most of our effort designing and programming the user interface elements of the project, rather than simply focusing on the pure game development aspects.

Explanation:

In our user interfaces class, we had to work on a semester long group project. What the project would be about was left up to us as long as it displayed a strong focus on user interface design, and so we collectively decided to work on a Unity project. This then evolved into us attempting to make a turn based role playing game, as we figured that would offer plenty of opportunities to showcase some UI.

The game itself is clearly unfinished, but we did at least manage to get an actual working prototype that allows the player to take on quests, engage with some enemies in turn based combat, customize their character a little, purchase items from a shop, and view their health and magic. Basically, as a game, it is unfinished, as a prototype, I would call it finished for what it is.

As with any project, there were some frustrations, but on the whole, I enjoyed working with my group, and am proud of what we were able to create together.
